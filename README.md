# Telomere-to-telomere of CN1 Han Chinese



**INPORTANT NOTE**

All datasets are prepared and ready to release, however, becasuse of policy issue, we need to hold 1-2 month for permission then to make it piblic. 

All raw sequence data used in this study are available for CN1 at GitHub: https://github.com/T2T-CN1/CN1. The reads are also deposited in the CNCB under accession number HRA004405. The final CN1 curated assemblies are available in the CNCB with the accession number GWHCBHP00000000 under the BioProject ID PRJCA016397. The accession numbers for the maternal and paternal haplotypes are GWHCBHM00000000 and GWHCBHQ00000000 in CNCB. We also submitted the assemblies to CNGB with the accession numbers of CNA0069006-CNA0069008 for combined, maternal, and paternal genome, respectively. The sample datasets are available on CNGB with the BioProject ID CNP0004252. Assemblies, annotation, and variant results are available at https://genome.zju.edu.cn.
